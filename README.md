# MaXLinker
MaXLinker is a software designed to identify cross-links from cross-linking massspectrometry (XL-MS) data.

## 1. What is MaXLinker?
MaXLinker is a search engine designed to identify cross-links from cross-linking mass
spectrometry (XL-MS) data. More specifically it can identify cross-links from samples cross-
linked by any cleavable cross-linker using MS2-MS3 XL-MS fragmentation strategy.

## 2. Dependencies:
• Python 3.7
• Tkinter (Usually an integral part of python installation)
• Proteome Discoverer 2.1

## 3. Installation and Running
   Download the MaXLinker copy specific to your OS (Linux/Mac/Windows) from: https://yulab.org/resources/MaxLinker/ 
  Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit):
  (i) Download the Linux-specific folder “MaXLinker_Linux.zip” and unzip it
  (ii) The applications can be launched by the following commands through terminal
  Pre-processing: “python3 maxlinker_preprocess_gui.py”
  Main search: “python3 maxlinker_gui.py”
  Mac (Tested on Mac OS High Sierra version 10.13.4):
  (i) Download the Mac-specific folder “MaXLinker_Mac.zip” and unzip it
  (ii) The applications can be launched by the following commands through terminal
  Pre-processing: “python3 maxlinker_preprocess_gui.py”
  Main search: “python3 maxlinker_gui.py”
  Windows (Tested on Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit)
  (i) Download the Windows-specific folder “MaXLinker_Windows.zip” and unzip it
  (ii) The applications can be launched by double-clicking specific scripts
  Pre-processing: Double-click “MaXLinker_Preprocess.bat”
  Main search: Double-click “MaXLinker_Main.bat”

## 4. Demo
 Please refer "MaXLinkerManual.pdf" for detailed instructions (along with screen shots) for running the software.
 All the sample input and output files needed for the Demo run are available in folder "Demo_files" 

The expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer is ~2 minutes

## 5. Instructions for use
 Please refer "MaXLinkerManual.pdf" for detailed instructions (along with screen shots) for deatiled instructions.
